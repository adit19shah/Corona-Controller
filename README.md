# CORONA-CONTROLLER
MATLAB software of the algorithm developed as a part of  Semester Project of SC 205 course.(Instructor: Prof. Manish K. Gupta)
It demonstrates how concepts of Discrete Mathematics like probability and Graph theory can be used to solve major problems we are facing today.

The software(MATLAB program) which  I have attached here performs required simulations if we feed it all the data of interaction-graph 
in the format specified at the beginning of  the code. Thereafter it asks user to enter which person is diagnosed positive specifying 
which it allows the user to simulate as many days as he/she wants in the software and outputs Corona score of the entire population 
at the end of each day.

If you just want to test the software without entering your own data, you may download the "Sample data for simulation.mat" file. 

The code is sufficiently commented to be self-explanatory.
